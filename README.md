VM.C
      *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***
  Use "gcc -g vm.c" to generate a program file from the .c file.
You can now run the program while passing in your input file with this 
command: "./a.out input_file.txt".
During runtime, insert any required values into the terminal to progress 
the program until the HLT command is reached.
The expected output will be shown directly in the terminal.
      *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

PARSERCODEGEN.C
  To use this code and compile it, use "gcc parsercodegen.c"
Once it is compiled, use "./a.out " followed by a file name (must be .txt!)
Output will be displayed on screen as well as in parseOut.txt in the same directory.
